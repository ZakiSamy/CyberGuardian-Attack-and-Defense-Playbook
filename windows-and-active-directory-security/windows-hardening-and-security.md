# Windows Hardening and Security

## Windows Endpoint Hardening Checklist

***

This checklist is designed to enhance the security of Windows endpoints by configuring and hardening Windows systems.&#x20;

### Minimize Attack Surface

***

* Disable unnecessary services.
* Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
* Implement a patch management.
* Keep the system up to date with the latest patches and updates.

### Reduce Privilege Escalation

***

* Enforce a strong password policy.
* Enable two-factor authentication where possible.
* Restrict user privileges.
* Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

### Legacy Protocol Mitigation

***

Address vulnerabilities related to legacy protocols and services

* Stop using SMB1.
* Disable PowerShell 2.0.
* Address vulnerabilities related to TLS 1.0/1.1 and SSL.
* Ensure LanMan (LM) and NTLMv1 are disabled.
* Disable Digest Authentication.

### OS Hardening

***

Implement various OS hardening measures, including

* Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) and Anti-Exploit rules.
* AV configuration.
* Microsoft's App & Browser Control.
* Restricting lateral movement tools and techniques.

### Software Cleanup

***

* Identify and remove unused or unnecessary software to reduce potential attack vectors.

### Network Security

***

Secure network-related settings by

* Disabling or hardening RDP.
* Preventing SmartNameResolution.
* Removing local admin rights.
* Disabling DNS Multicast.
* Disabling NetBios.
* Configuring the Windows Firewall.
* Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
* Implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).
* Consider network segmentation to limit lateral movement and malware propagation.

### Account Protections

***

Protect user accounts by

* Removing local admin rights.
* Disabling DNS Multicast.
* Disabling NetBios.
* Configuring the Windows Firewall.
* Implementing Office Suite hardening.
* Utilizing the Protected Users group (for Active Directory joined devices).
* Enabling Credential Guard.

### Application Hardening

***

Secure common applications by:

* Identifying application vulnerabilities.
* Evaluating needs and risks.
* Researching hardening techniques.
* Implementing comprehensive configurations.

### Browser Security

***

Enhance web browser security by:

* Enforcing Smartscreen Phishing Filter and Advanced Protection.
* Isolating browser processes through dedicated sandboxing.
* Controlling installed extensions.
* Researching hardening techniques for specific browsers.

### Enhance Monitoring and Logging

***

* Monitor Windows Event Logs.
* Enable Windows Defender Firewall and Antivirus.

### Group Policy Management

***

* Define Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security policies.

### Protect Data

***

* Encrypt the hard drive with Bitlocker.
