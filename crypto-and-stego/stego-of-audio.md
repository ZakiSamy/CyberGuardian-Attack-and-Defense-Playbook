# Stego of Audio

In this section, we will delve into audio steganography â€“ the art of concealing data within audio recordings.

### What is Audio Steganography?

Audio steganography is a method that allows cyber attackers to hide sensitive or covert information within audio files in a way that is imperceptible to the human ear. This technique has both legitimate and malicious applications. It can be used for secure communication, copyright protection, and even watermarking, but it can also be exploited by cybercriminals for covert data exfiltration and espionage.

### Unmasking the Secrets in Audio

Imagine you have come across an audio file that appears innocent on the surface but may be hiding concealed data, perhaps a hidden message, malicious code, or sensitive information. To investigate further, we can employ tools like Sonic Visualizer, which is an open-source software designed for visualizing and analyzing audio data.

### The Sonic Visualizer Method

Follow these steps to uncover hidden data from an audio file using Sonic Visualizer:

1. **Open Sonic Visualizer**: Launch the Sonic Visualizer software on your computer.
2. **Select File**: Navigate to the audio file you wish to inspect and select it for analysis.
3. **Right Click**: Right-click on the loaded audio file to access the context menu.
4. **Layer**: In the context menu, choose the "Layer" option. This is where we will add a spectrogram layer to visualize the audio.
5. **Add Spectrogram**: Select "Add Spectrogram" within the Layer submenu. This action will generate a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the audio's frequency content over time.

By creating a spectrogram, we can identify anomalies, hidden patterns, or unusual frequencies within the audio file that might indicate the presence of hidden data.
