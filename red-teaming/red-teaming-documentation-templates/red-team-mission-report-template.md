### 3.8. Scenarios Definitions

## Scenario #1: Active Directory Enumeration

***

### **Objective**

* **Objective:** The objective of this scenario was to enumerate the Active Directory environment to gather information about domain controllers, user accounts, and group policies.

### **Description**

* **Description:** The Red Team used open-source and custom tools to gather information about the Active Directory structure and user accounts.
* **Result:** Successful enumeration of domain controllers, user accounts, and group policies.

### **Flags**

* **Flags:** The following flags were achieved:
  * Successful enumeration of domain controllers and administrative accounts.
  * Discovery of group policies that may be vulnerable to exploitation.

### **Operations: Initial Point**

* **Operations: Initial Point:** The Red Team initiated this scenario by gaining access to a compromised internal workstation.

### **Attacker**

* **Attacker:** Red Team Member: John Smith

### **Location**

* **Location:** The operation took place within the Company Inc. internal network.

### **Initial Information**

* **Initial Information:** No specific initial information was available for this scenario.

### **Findings**

* The Active Directory enumeration revealed sensitive information about domain controllers, including their IP addresses and version information.
* Several user accounts with weak passwords were identified, posing a security risk.
* Group policies related to password policies and remote access were identified as potential points of exploitation.

### **Recommendations**

* Implement network segmentation to restrict access to critical assets.
* Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
* Regularly update and patch domain controllers to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
* Review and harden group policies to minimize security risks.
