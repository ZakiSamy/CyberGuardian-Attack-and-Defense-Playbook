# Red Team Exercise Planning Checklist

## Introduction

***

Planning a successful Red Team exercise requires careful consideration of various aspects to ensure that the objectives are met efficiently and ethically. This checklist will guide you through the essential steps in planning a Red Team exercise.

## Negative Motivations

***

* Ensure the exercise is not motivated by negative intentions, such as proving insecurity or displaying dominance.
* Focus on constructive goals rather than seeking vulnerabilities for shock value.
* Emphasize the importance of security testing over enumerating as many vulnerabilities as possible.

## Stakeholders

***

* Identify key stakeholders who will champion the exercise's outcomes.
* Ensure there is leadership or influencer sponsorship for the exercise.
* Confirm openness to change and have sponsorship in place to drive necessary changes.
* Ensure the organization willingly participates in the exercise and is receptive to risk calibration.

## Time Estimations

***

* Project the timeline from the planning phase to mitigation or other phases.
* Plan for the following timeframes:
  * Planning (Weeks/Months)
  * Attack (Minutes/Weeks)
  * Response (Hours/Weeks)
  * Tabletop (Days/Weeks)
  * Incident Response (Short Term) (Days/Weeks)
  * Red Team Reveal (Hours)
  * Incident Response (Post Mortem) (Hours/Days)
  * Long-Term Mitigation (Weeks/Months)

## People

***

* Identify all individuals who need to be informed about the Red Team's plans and activities.
* Consider:
  * Hiring external consulting firms for the Red Team.
  * Involvement of internal resources.
  * Roles for notifying authorities, PR, and customer interactions.
  * Breach notification resources.
  * Designate a "Game Master" responsible for guiding the exercise and decision-making.

## Strategy

***

* Define where the value will be derived from the Red Team exercise.
* Consider whether potential defenders are aware of the Red Team's expected involvement.
* Decide whether to announce a timeframe for the exercise to generate preparation momentum.
* Determine the level of guidance for attackers, balancing realism and discovery.
* Set clear rules regarding shaming and emphasize the exercise's educational nature.
* Clarify that the Red Team exercise is a gift to the Blue Team, not a punitive measure.
* Decide on a specific attack method or realistic "kill chain" to frame the exercise.

## Attack Design

***

* Assess the level of expertise and effort required for the attack.
* Evaluate if external parties are necessary for the exercise.
* Determine the starting point in the kill chain (e.g., spear phishing or lateral movement).
* Identify required credentials, access, or documentation for the attack.
* Decide if the Red Team should shift to penetration testing or vulnerability assessment upon early success.
* Consider whether the attacker should impersonate a specific adversary or attack method.
* Plan for contingencies and a second attack if the Red Team is detected.
* Establish methods for documenting Red Team behaviors and actions during the exercise.

## Incident Response

***

* Anticipate the maturity level of the incident response process.
* Decide if the response should be heavily guided or allow natural responses.
* Plan for artificial incidents to test specific response aspects.
* Consider the role of the "Game Master" in escalating or controlling the incident.
* Identify the communication bridge between the Red Team and Blue Team for questions or concerns.
* Allocate responsibilities for documenting Red Team pain points and lessons learned.
* Plan how to leak indicators to the Blue Team if incident response stalls.
* Collect short-term mitigations and long-term preventive measures as part of incident response.

## Red Team Reveal

***

* Ensure that Red Team actions during the attack phase are thoroughly documented and understood.
* Confirm that the incident response process has not missed significant Red Team actions.
* Check for any remaining indicators of compromise (IOCs) or artifacts that could be discovered later.
* Verify that backdoors or other risky changes have been properly addressed.
* Assess the thoroughness of the Blue Team's investigation and containment efforts.

## Post Mortem

***

* Conduct comprehensive interviews and debriefs with all exercise participants.
* Gather and prioritize follow-up mitigation items based on participant feedback.
* Share sentiments and conclusions with participants through presentations.
* Schedule and organize meetings for presenting the findings.
* Arrange for Red Team members to provide insights and answer questions.
* Consider providing rewards or recognition to participants.
* Allow participants ample time for debriefing and discussion.
* Use the exercise as a valuable calibration tool for practical risks
