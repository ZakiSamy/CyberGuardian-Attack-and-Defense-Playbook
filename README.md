# Our Mission and Values
At CyberGuardian, we believe in the accessibility of cybersecurity education and training resources. We are dedicated to the following principles:
- **Free Cybersecurity Education**: Education is a fundamental right that should be accessible to all, fostering continuous improvement and empowerment. We are committed to offering valuable resources at no cost.
- **Condensed Knowledge**: In an age of information overload, we've done the research, organization, and writing to condense critical cybersecurity knowledge into one comprehensive playbook. We aim to help you learn faster without the need to scour thousands of pages or blogs.
- **Acknowledging the Community**: We greatly appreciate the cybersecurity community's generosity in sharing knowledge. Many of the techniques and insights presented here are a result of this collaboration. We always provide proper references to the original authors.

# Bridging the Gap Between Defense and Offense
In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, we understand the need to combine defensive and offensive security practices. We believe that to be a better attacker, you must also be a proficient defender. Conversely, effective defense requires understanding offensive tactics. Our goal is not to merely showcase hacking abilities but to enhance overall security postures, improve preparedness for breaches and incidents, and promote a deeper understanding of the cybersecurity ecosystem. Whether you're a blue teamer, ethical hacker, red teamer, or bug bounty hunter, our playbook offers valuable insights that can elevate your skills.
