# Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability Management is identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, flaws and weaknesses within an organization's digital infrastructure. This proactive approach helps protect against cyber threats and ensures the resilience of systems and networks.

## Vulnerability Management Concepts

***

* **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):** CVSS is a standardized method for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. It assigns a numerical score to each vulnerability, allowing organizations to prioritize and address high-risk issues.
* **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):** CVE is a comprehensive database of known vulnerabilities. Each CVE entry includes a unique identifier, description, and references, enabling security professionals to quickly identify and reference specific vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Vulnerability scanning is a proactive technique used to identify vulnerabilities within a network or system. It involves the use of specialized tools to scan for known vulnerabilities and potential weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Scanners

***

Vulnerability scanners are automated software tools used to identify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. They perform systematic assessments by scanning for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Vulnerability scanners are essential for maintaining and improving the security posture of an organization's digital assets.

* **Network Vulnerability Scanners:** Network vulnerability scanners focus on identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the network infrastructure, including servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices. They primarily assess network-level vulnerabilities, such as open ports, missing patches, and insecure configurations. Examples of network vulnerability scanners include Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.
* **Web Application Vulnerability Scanners:** Web application vulnerability scanners, as the name suggests, are specialized tools designed to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, websites, and web services. They target issues specific to web technologies, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and insecure authentication mechanisms. Popular web application vulnerability scanners include OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Acunetix.

### **Pros of Vulnerability Scanners**

1. **Efficiency:** Vulnerability scanners automate the detection process, allowing for rapid and comprehensive assessments of systems or applications.
2. **Consistency:** Scanners provide consistent and repeatable results, reducing the risk of human error in manual assessments.
3. **Timeliness:** They can quickly identify vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to address security issues promptly.
4. **Coverage:** Vulnerability scanners can assess a wide range of systems or applications, including those that may be difficult for humans to review thoroughly.
5. **Reporting:** They generate detailed reports with prioritized vulnerabilities, helping organizations focus on critical issues.

### **Cons of Vulnerability Scanners:**

1. **False Positives/Negatives:** Scanners may produce false-positive or false-negative results, requiring human verification and analysis.
2. **Limited Context:** They may lack the ability to understand the context of certain vulnerabilities, leading to incomplete assessments.
3. **Complex Vulnerabilities:** Some advanced or zero-day vulnerabilities may go undetected by scanners.
4. **Scanning Overhead:** Vulnerability scans can consume network and system resources, potentially affecting performance.
5. **Cost:** Many commercial vulnerability scanners come with a significant price tag, making them less accessible to smaller organizations.
