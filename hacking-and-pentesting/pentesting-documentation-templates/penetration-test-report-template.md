## 5. Attack Narrative

***

### Methodology

The penetration test followed a systematic methodology that included the following phases:

1. **Information Gathering:**
   * During this initial phase, we conducted passive reconnaissance to collect publicly available information about Company Inc.'s external network and web application. We utilized open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques, including searches on search engines, social media platforms, and domain registration databases.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning:**
   * Utilizing the Nmap and Nessus tools, we performed an active scan of Company Inc.'s external network infrastructure to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This phase allowed us to target specific systems and applications for further assessment.
3. **Web Application Testing:**
   * Focusing on the [www.company.com](http://www.company.com/) web application, we conducted an extensive examination to identify security vulnerabilities. This included manual and automated testing for common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms. Burp Suite was used to intercept and analyze HTTP traffic.
4. **Exploitation:**
   * Building upon the vulnerabilities identified during the previous phases, we conducted targeted exploitation attempts. We successfully exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form of the web application, gaining unauthorized access to the backend database.
5. **Post-Exploitation:**
   * Following successful exploitation, we further investigated the compromised system. We enumerated database contents, extracted sensitive data, and escalated privileges to demonstrate the potential impact of the breach. Metasploit Framework and custom scripts were employed to aid in post-exploitation activities.

### Web Application Exploitation

### SQL Injection Exploitation

* **Vulnerability:** The login form of the [www.company.com](http://www.company.com/) web application was found to be susceptible to SQL injection. Specifically, the "username" and "password" parameters were identified as vulnerable.
* **Exploitation Steps:**
  1. **Initial Identification:** During web application testing, we input the following payload in the "username" field: `' OR 1=1 --`.
  2. **Exploitation:** Upon submission, the application granted access without requiring a valid password, confirming the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.
  3. **Data Extraction:** We further leveraged the vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and customer information.
  4. **Privilege Escalation:** In a simulated scenario, we escalated our privileges to a database administrator, showcasing the severity of the vulnerability.

This successful exploitation highlights the critical nature of the SQL injection vulnerability, demonstrating that an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and potentially compromise the integrity of Company Inc.'s web application.
