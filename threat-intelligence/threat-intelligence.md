# Threat Intelligence

## What is Threat Intelligence?

***

Cyber threat intelligence serves as a cornerstone in modern cybersecurity strategies, empowering organizations to proactively safeguard their digital assets. It encompasses the understanding of threat actors, their methodologies, and the evolving threat landscape. Within the realm of threat intelligence, there exists a spectrum that includes:

#### Data

* Data comprises raw, unprocessed facts, often in substantial volumes.

#### Information

* Information emerges when data is collected and structured for analysis.

#### Intelligence

* Intelligence represents the culmination of processed and analyzed information, serving as a foundation for informed decision-making.

## Purpose of Threat Intelligence

***

The utilization of threat intelligence is threefold:

#### Predict

* Predictive threat intelligence anticipates incoming threats, be they from threat actors or evolving business risks.

#### Prevent

* Preventative threat intelligence aids in averting incidents based on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and threat actor signatures.

#### Detect and Respond

* Threat intelligence also contributes to the detection of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and assists in responding to existing incidents.

## Threat Intelligence Cycle

***

The threat intelligence process revolves around a continuous cycle:

* **Planning and Direction**
  * Determining what information to collect and how to collect it efficiently.
* **Collection**
  * Gathering relevant data from various sources.
* **Processing and Analysis**
  * Transforming collected data into actionable insights through thorough analysis.
* **Reporting**
  * Disseminating intelligence to decision-makers and relevant stakeholders.

## Levels of Threat Intelligence

***

Threat intelligence exists on multiple levels, each with distinct focuses:

### Strategic

* Strategical intelligence centers around business risks and the broader threat landscape.

### Tactical

* Tactical intelligence delves into the TTPs employed by threat actors and encompasses IoCs. It fuels signature updates, fortifying security systems against attacks, and supports proactive controls such as threat hunting.

### Operational

* Operational intelligence aids in the day-to-day defense against threats.

## Data Sources of Intelligence

***

Threat intelligence is derived from diverse sources, including:

* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** encompassing hashes, IPs, and domains.
* **Client data and logs:** SIEM, security devices, EDR, deep web, dark web, messaging platforms, social media, and more.
* **Human intelligence:** malware analysis, geopolitical developments, code repositories, paste sites, and sharing platforms.
* **Cyber Threat Intelligence Services:** including standalone engagements and threat assessments.
* **Threat monitoring:** through subscriptions, Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs), and data feeds.
